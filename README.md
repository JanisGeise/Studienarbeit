# Robust model-based deep reinforcement learning for flow control

## Overview
This student thesis project aims to implement a model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling the
flow past a cylinder. Therefore, the [drlfoam](https://github.com/OFDataCommittee/drlfoam) repository, which already 
provides a model-free version is used as a starting point.

This project is a continuation of the work done by [Darshan Thummar](https://github.com/darshan315/flow_past_cylinder_by_DRL) and
[Fabian Gabriel](https://github.com/FabianGabriel/Active_flow_control_past_cylinder_using_DRL), a first attempt to use a model-based
approach in order to accelerate the training process was implemented by [Eric Schulze](https://github.com/FabianGabriel/Active_flow_control_past_cylinder_using_DRL).
